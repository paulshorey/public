This year developed a niche micro-SaaS API product: <a href=\\\"https://besta.domains\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">besta.domains</a> for registrars and consumers. Making a quality product takes a long time! The bulk of the work is done. Now I can go back to a full time job and do sales, marketing, and remaining development during evenings and weekends. </p> <p> Also in my spare time, I'll be writing content about what is hurting the web right now - broken content/advertising model, annoying popups/notifications, broken/dead sites, messy search results, cluttered inbox from too many newsletters because of no standardized syndication of content, outdated search results, and political confirmation bias / distrust of media. Will be suggesting solutions to help people get the most from the web. Already made one solution, a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/paulshorey/FlySwatterTech\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">browser extension</a> to close those pesky \\\"cookies\\\" and \\\"newsletter\\\" popups which are so annoying! </p> <hr/> <p> Married to the smartest and kindest woman. Samira not only supports my endeavors, but contributes. Together, we made the world's most accurate and culturally sensitive English language <a href=\\\"https://besta.domains\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">thesaurus</a>. Whatever I am developing, she helps with research, design, content, and user testing. As part of our wedding, <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj9AAwN0XWI\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">we jumped out of an airplane</a> together, both for the first time. </p> <hr/> <p> BFA in <b>Media Arts (interactive, digital media + design)</b>. I actually taught myself programming to pay off the art-school student loans. I've grown to embrace programming as my art medium of choice. It's creative and interesting. I get to make something from nothing. It's like knowing magic. It's like having a superpower! </p> <hr/> <p> Taking a break from mountain adventures for a while to<b> focus 150% on tech</b>. Got laser vision! Lasik made my eyes extra tired at first, but now I can stare at the screen for longer than ever before. No glasses. No distortion. Less eye strain! </p> <hr/> <p> I enjoy <b>Instagram: <a href=\\\"https://instagram.com/paul.shorey\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">@paul.shorey</a></b>. Do not use Facebook. Just got onto <a href=\\\"https://linkedin.com/in/paulshorey\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/paulshoreytech\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Twitter</a>. Need to find time to publish photos to 500px.com or similar platform. <a href=\\\"javascript:void('open contact')\\\" onclick='document.querySelector(\\\".eapps-form-floating-button\\\").click()'>What photography platform do you use? Please let me know.</a> </p> <hr/> <p> Total foodie. The weirder and more exotic the better. I've made my own squid ink pasta and truffled scallop risotto. Korean food, mmm! </p> <p> I was born in Russia, with barely enough food to eat (now a US citizen). My wife is a refugee from Africa. I got very comfortable in my bachelor days and lost the \\\"immigrant hustle\\\", but rediscovered it recently. I hustle now to make a more secure life for us and our families. I'm easy to work with. I'm not opinionated. Spaces or tabs, semicolons or not, naming conventions, choice of framework, architecture... I don't care, as long as we discuss it, as long as it can be easily maintained and refactored. I will not force any cutting edge or over-engineered techniques on you. However, on the evenings and weekends, in my personal projects, I'll always be innovating and trying new things. I do have some ideas to share, if you're interested. Just getting started. Learning now faster than ever. </p> <hr/> <p> <b>Music I listen to while programming:</b><br/> <a href=\\\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=PmjVli7eC8M\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Boogaloo Joe Jones ‚ô† Psychedelic Jazz Guitar ‚ô† 1967</a> <br/> <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNRIFhkYONc&t=497s\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">70s Japanese Jazz</a><br/> <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-I5GN5XCKs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Relax African Music | Jabali Spirit</a><br/> <a href=\\\"https://8tracks.com/kentgowran/open-your-heart\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Open Your Heart</a><br/> <a href=\\\"https://8tracks.com/philia_bb/ambient-frequencies\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Ambient Frequencies</a><br/> <u>Pink</u> album by <i>Boris</i><br/> <u>No Closure</u> album by <i>Merzbow</i><br/> and ambient drone music by <a href=\\\"https://paulminesweeper.ml/track/lighthouse\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><i>Paul Minesweeper</i></a> </p> <hr/> <p>When not programming, I listen to podcasts, and whatever music my wife puts on.</p> <hr/> <p> <b><a href=\\\"javascript:void('open contact')\\\" onclick='document.querySelector(\\\".eapps-form-floating-button\\\").click()'>üóìÔ∏è Let's meet!</a></b> </p> </div> </div> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;"],"sourceRoot":""}
